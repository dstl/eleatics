# Argumentation

It supports _presumptive_ reasoning; letting you construct an argument that infers a conclusion from premises regardless of whether that inference is correct or not \(though you presume it is\). One argument can be attacked by another that _undermines_ its premise, _rebuts_ its conclusion, or _undercuts_ its inference. An attacked argument can be defended by attacking its attacker, and so it goes…

## Mathematics
Mathematically, argumentation can be modelled as a graph - with nodes representing arguments, and directed edges representing the attacks between them. This is the seminal *argumentation framework* proposed by Phan Minh Dung. Given a set of arguments, Dung deems that an individual argument is *acceptable* if it isn't attacked by any other members of the set, or if it is defended by successful attacks on its attackers.
