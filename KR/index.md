# Knowledge Representation

*Collaborative and distributed knowledge representation* is essentially the job description for [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data). Linked data models are eminently suitable for [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), but some consideration needs to be given to representing these same models for people as well. 

## Concepts
It will be necessary to classify concepts for the purpose of reasoning. For example, we might want to consider some of the premises in an argument as *evidence*, and some of the conclusions as *hypotheses*. We'll use [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) for this purpose.

## HTML
Facts laid out as text as on a web page for the human reader can be made accessible to a machine through [semantic mark-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML). In particular, [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) allows [linked data](https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to be embedded in HTML.
