# Knowledge Representation

### HTML
We want arguments that make sense to both humans and machines. An argument can be laid out text as on a web page for the human reader that  
is made accessible to a machine reasoning agent through [semantic mark-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML). In particular, [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) allows [linked data](https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to be embedded in HTML.
