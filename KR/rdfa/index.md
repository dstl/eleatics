# RDFa

*Resource Description Framework in Attributes ([RDFa](http://rdfa.info/))*

**[rdfa-ntriples.xsl](../xsl/rdfa-ntriples.xsl)** is an XSL stylesheet that transforms RDFa attributes in XML to create [RDF N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/). It's beta level code put together from the description in the [RDFa Primer](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/), and somewhat loosely tested by applying it to [XHTML+RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML%2BRDFa) web pages and comparing outputs with those generated by [RDFa Play](http://rdfa.info/play/) and [RDF Translator](https://rdf-translator.appspot.com/) for the same pages.
