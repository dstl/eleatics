*Interfaces, interchange formats and data transformations to promote shared, collaborative and distributed knowledge representation and reasoning.*

Interfaces and data exchange formats let disparate organisations collaborate in sharing information. Reasoning may also be collaborative; with different agents, be they machine or human, looking at the same problem from different viewpoints and perhaps reaching different conclusions. This means collaborative reasoning must support dialogue and dispute - which is why [argumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory) features heavily here.

The general principle is to exploit existing methods as much as possible, develop best practice, and demonstrate through worked examples.
