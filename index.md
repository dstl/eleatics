*Interfaces, interchange formats and data transformations to promote shared, collaborative and distributed knowledge representation and reasoning.*

* [Argumentation](argumentation)

Interfaces and data exchange formats allow disparate organisations to collaborate. Sharing information is one thing, reasoning over that information to infer knowledge is another. Reasoning may be collaborative, with different agents (be they machine or human) looking at the same problem from different viewpoints; and perhaps reaching different conclusions. This means collaborative reasoning must support dialogue and dispute - which is why [argumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory) features heavily here.


Arguably, "collaborative and distributed knowledge representation" is a job description for [linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) - and many tools and techniques for reasoning over linked data exist.  

The general principle is to reuse existing methods as much as possible, to develop best practice, and to demonstrate it through worked examples. Data transformation utilities are published in the GitHub repository and described in the corresponding technical [wiki](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/wiki).
