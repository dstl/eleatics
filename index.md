*Interfaces, interchange formats and data transformations to promote shared, collaborative and distributed knowledge representation and reasoning.*

Interfaces and data exchange formats allow disparate organisations to collaborate in sharing information. Sharing information is one thing, reasoning over that information to infer knowledge is another. Reasoning may also be collaborative, with different agents (be they machine or human) looking at the same problem from different viewpoints; and perhaps reaching different conclusions. This means collaborative reasoning must support dialogue and dispute - which is why [argumentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory) features heavily here.

The general principle is to exploit existing methods as much as possible, develop best practice, and demonstrate through worked examples. Data transformation utilities are published in the GitHub repository and described in the corresponding technical [wiki](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/wiki). The repository is published under the [MIT licence](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/blob/master/LICENSE).
