<xhtml:dd about="context:direct" typeof="aif:I-node" property="aif:claimText">There is transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (or very closely-related progenitor virus) from an animal reservoir host to human, followed by direct person-to-person transmission with or without the need for adaptation of the virus to humans. The speed of dissemination will depend on chance events such as superspreading events.</xhtml:dd>
