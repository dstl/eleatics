# Origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

The WHO report into the [origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus) has a section 
discussing four possible pathways of emergence for the virus and presenting arguments for and against each hypothesis.

We can take the facts expressed in these arguments and create an [information list](information.xhtml). Entries from this list may be 
used as I-nodes in an AIF argument map. For example this argument map aims to reconstruct the arguments presented in the WHO report:

See the project's [*Argumentation*](/argumentation) page for instructions on extracting AIF from this GraphML.
