# Origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

The WHO report into the [origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus) has a section 
discussing four possible pathways of emergence for the virus and presenting arguments for and against each hypothesis.

These arguments may be used to construct an argument map.

We can take the facts expressed in these arguments and create an information list. Entries from this list may be used as I-nodes in an 
AIF argument map. For example this argument map aims to reconstruct the arguments presented in the WHO report.
