		<h3>Direct transmission</h3>
		<p>The arguments in favour of direct zoonotic transmission are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><p>
		The majority of emerging diseases originate from animal reservoirs and there is strong evidence that most of the current human coronaviruses have originated from animals.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Seeding of SARS-CoV-2 in mink populations has shown that these animals are highly susceptible as well and the current evidence available cannot rule out the possibility for minks as the primary source of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Bats are a known reservoir for many zoonotic viruses (with high virus diversity globally); they have the highest proportion of projected zoonotic viruses of any mammalian order. In addition, bat ecology favours virus circulation (large populations, birthing waves, and closely spaced communities).</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Also, SARSr-CoV strains have been found in pangolins and various bats; and these do bind to hACE2. However, because several contact residues between the bat and pangolin viruses and the hACE2 receptor are distinct from those in SARS-CoV-2, the affinity is low, and the viruses are genetically still quite distinct from SARSâ€“CoV-2.
		</p>
		<p>
		An argument against direct zoonotic transmission is the fact that both these putative hosts are infrequently in contact with humans, and an intermediary step involving an amplifying host has been observed for several other emerging viruses (Henipaviruses, influenzaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

		<h3>Introduction through intermediate host followed by direct zoonotic transmission</h3>

		<p>The arguments in favour of <span about="context:intermediate" property="aif:claimText">transmission via an intermediate host</span> are:</p>
		
		<ul about="context:intermediate" typeof="aif:I-node" rev="aif:conclusion">
		<li about="context:ra1" typeof="aif:RA-node" rel="aif:premise">
		<p>Both bat and pangolin putative hosts are infrequently in contact with humans, and an intermediary step involving <span about="context:otheramplifiers" class="premise">an amplifying host has been observed for several other emerging viruses</span> (Henipaviruses, influenzaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-2 infection and intraspecies spread (including further transmission to humans) has been documented in an increasing number of animal species, particularly mustelids and felids.</p>
		</li>
		<li about="context:ra2" typeof="aif:RA-node" rel="aif:premise">

		<p>The increasing number of animals shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 includes <span about="context:farmedanimals" class="premise">animals that are farmed in sufficient densities to allow potential for enzootic circulation</span>.</p>
		</li>
		<li about="context:ra4" typeof="aif:RA-node" rel="aif:premise">
		<p>In high-density farms, <span about="context:farmconnections" class="premise">there often are connections between farms</span> (for instance, through the workforce and food supply), leading to complex transmission pathways that may be difficult to unravel, as was observed in other zoonotic outbreaks involving farmed animals.</p>
		</li>
		<li about="context:ra5" typeof="aif:RA-node" rel="aif:premise">
		<p>Optimized <span about="context:farmtransmission" class="premise">conditions for sustained virus transmission chains in large-scale animal farms</span> may also impact on virus seasonality in favour of a year-round endemic transmission pattern, and thereby increasing the zoonotic risk in winter months.</p>

		<p><span about="context:farmingdensity" typeof="aif:I-node" class="premise" property="aif:claimText">High-density farming</span> is common in many places across the world and includes many livestock species as well as farmed wildlife; and there was <span about="context:farmconnections" typeof="aif:I-node" class="premise">a large network of domesticated wild animal farms</span>, supplying farmed wildlife to Wuhan.</p>

		<li about="context:ca1" typeof="aif:CA-node" rel="aif:premise">
		<p>SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in an increasing number of animal species, but genetic and epidemiological studies have suggested that these were <span about="context:infectionfromhumans" class="premise">infections introduced from humans</span>, rather than enzootic virus circulation.</p>

		<li about="context:ca2" typeof="aif:CA-node" rel="aif:premise">
		<p>Since the containment of SARS-CoV-2 in China, new outbreaks have occurred for which genomic sequence data was generated.
