		<p>Both bat and pangolin putative hosts are infrequently in contact with humans, and an intermediary step involving <span resource="context:otheramplifiers" property="aif:Premise" class="premise">an amplifying host has been observed for several other emerging viruses</span> (Henipaviruses, influenzaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV).

		<p>In high-density farms, <span resource="context:farmconnections" property="aif:Premise" class="premise">there often are connections between farms</span> (for instance, through the workforce and food supply), leading to complex transmission pathways that may be difficult to unravel, as was observed in other zoonotic outbreaks involving farmed animals.</p>

		<p>Optimized <span resource="context:farmtransmission" property="aif:Premise" class="premise">conditions for sustained virus transmission chains in large-scale animal farms</span> may also impact on virus seasonality in favour of a year-round endemic transmission pattern, and thereby increasing the zoonotic risk in winter months.</p>

		<li about="context:indirectca1" typeof="aif:CA-node">
		<p>SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in an increasing number of animal species, but genetic and epidemiological studies have suggested that these were <span resource="context:infectionfromhumans" property="aif:Premise" class="premise">infections introduced from humans</span>, rather than enzootic virus circulation.</p>

		<p>Since the containment of SARS-CoV-2 in China, new outbreaks have occurred for which genomic sequence data was generated.

		<p>There was <span resource="context:animalstested" property="aif:Premise" class="premise">no genetic or serological evidence for SARS-CoV-2 in a wide range of domestic and wild animals</span> tested to date. The screening of the major livestock species was done across the country and provided no evidence for circulation of a related virus. The scale of testing in these species was such that widespread circulation is extremely unlikely.</p>
