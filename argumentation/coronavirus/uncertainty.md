# Uncertainty

In most cases, as in the [Origins of SARS-CoV-2](index.html) example, evaluating an argument map doesn't produce a definite answer; and
there is *uncertainty* associated with any conclusions you might draw.

Consider the arguments for and against just the laboratory origin hypothesis in isolation:

[![argument map regarding lab origin](origin-lab.svg)](origin-lab.graphml)

Evaluating this argument map will produce a number of extensions, and in each extension the hypothesis will be either
"true" (acceptable) or "false" (unacceptable). We can collect all the "true" extensions into one set, and regard it as the
case in support of the hypothesis:

[![argument map for lab origin](origin-lab-for.svg)](origin-lab-for.graphml)

 ... and we can make the case against the lab origin in the same way:
 
 [![argument map against lab origin](origin-lab-against.svg)](origin-lab-against.graphml)
 
The "true" and "false" conclusions partition the set of all extensions, and we can choose how the acceptable arguments in each extension
combine to make an explanation graph for the partition. Here, we have chosen to consider *necessary* arguments, which is to say arguments
that are acceptable in all the extensions in a partition. In the case against the laboratory origin this includes two undercutting arguments.
Including these in an explanation graph requires including the arguments that are undercut. The case in favour of the lab hypothesis
