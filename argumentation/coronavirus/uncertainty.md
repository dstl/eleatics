# Uncertainty

In many (most?) cases, argument maps don't evaluate to 

Consider the arguments for and against the laboratory origin hypothesis in isolation:

[![argument map regarding lab origin](origin-lab.svg)](origin-lab.graphml)

Evaluating this argument map will produce a number of extensions, and in each extension the hypothesis will be either
"true" (acceptable) or "false" (unacceptable). We can collect all the "true" extensions into one set, and regard these as the
arguments that make the case in support of the hypothesis:

[![argument map for lab origin](origin-lab-for.svg)](origin-lab-for.graphml)

 and can make the case against the lab origin in the same way:
 
 [![argument map against lab origin](origin-lab-against.svg)](origin-lab-against.graphml)
