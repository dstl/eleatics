# Argumentation

Supporting the interchange of [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory) as *Argument Interchange Format* ([AIF](http://www.argumentinterchange.org/)).

## Representation

### Argument Maps

[OVA+](https://arg-tech.org/index.php/projects/ova-2/) is an online tool that lets you create and save an [argument map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map) as AIF. It's possible to draw the same sort of arguments map using something like the 
[yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed), and then transform the resulting diagram to AIF. The method is described on the
[eleatics wiki](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/wiki/Argument-Maps).
