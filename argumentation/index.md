# Argumentation

*Supporting the interchange of [argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory) as Argument Interchange Format ([AIF](http://www.argumentinterchange.org/)).*

## Representation

### Argument Maps
[OVA+](https://arg-tech.org/index.php/projects/ova-2/) is an online tool that lets you create and save an [argument map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map) as AIF. It's possible to draw the same sort of arguments map using something like the 
[yEd Graph Editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed), and then transform the resulting diagram to AIF.

* The method is described on the [eleatics wiki](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/wiki/Argument-Maps).

### HTML
We want arguments that make sense to both humans and machines. An argument can be laid out text as on a web page for the human reader that  
is made accessible to a machine reasoning agent through [semantic mark-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML). In particular, [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) allows [linked data](https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) to be embedded in HTML.
