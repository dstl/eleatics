This is an XSL transform to convert CISpaces format to AIF.

See the **cis-to-aif** target in the [build file](/argumentation/build.xml) for an example based on the [CAP16_Scenario_phase1.cis](https://github.com/CISpaces/webservices/blob/master/example_cis_files/CAP16_Scenario_phase1.cis) from the [CISpaces GitHub](https://github.com/CISpaces) repository.

The CISpaces format must first be converted from JSON to XML. This was done using the [JSON to XML Converter](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-to-xml-converter.html) from www.freeformatter.com, and accepting the default configuration, to give the result in file [CAP16_Scenario_phase1.xml](CAP16_Scenario_phase1.xml).
