# Argument Maps
The [yEd graph editor](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed) is a general purpose graph drawing tool that can be used to create argument maps. It stores graphs as [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/), which is an open standard XML format. [Argument Interchange Format (AIF)](http://www.argumentinterchange.org/) is an open standard for argumentation that can be expressed as [OWL/RDF](https://www.w3.org/OWL/). An argument map drawn in yEd can be transformed into the equivalent AIF with an [XSL transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT).

See [graphml-to-aif.xsl](https://dstl.github.io/eleatics/argumentation/xsl/graphml-to-aif.xsl) for a stylesheet that does just this, and here's how it works...

The object is to translate boxes and arrows in the argument map to AIF nodes and their linkages. This is relatively straightforward in the case of the [OVA-style argument maps](http://ova.arg-tech.org/), where diagrammatic nodes specifically depict AIF nodes. GraphML documents the nodes and edges of a graph and their properties. yEd allows _data properties_ to be defined on nodes and edges in a graph; and these are stored in the GraphML along with various properties relating to visualization and layout.

It would be possible to achieve the desired effect with an XSL stylesheet that just uses stylistic elements (shape, colour, etc.) of the argument map to create AIF. However, this would restrict the utility of the transformation to using yEd as the argument map editor, and then only allow a single style of argument map within yEd. Instead, the following custom data properties on graph nodes are defined:

![yEd custom properties](https://dstl.github.io/eleatics/images/yed_properties.png)

These custom properties are used alongside the **URL** and **Description** properties that yEd assigns to all nodes and edges by default.

Broadly, the transformation is as follows: Each yEd graph node is translated to an AIF node of type **nodeType**, which will have _URI_ set to the value of **URL** if that property is set, or will be an RDF blank node if not. The **Description** property becomes the _claimText_ of the AIF node. The **known** and **defeasible** properties translate into custom boolean RDF properties (currently _http://to.do/premise_ and _http://to.do/defeasible_) that extend AIF to provide hints for an evaluation of the argument. If **known** is true, then the AIF-node is presumably an I-node that is a premise of the argument. If **defeasible** is also true (or not specified) then it is an ordinary premise. If **defeasible** is false, then it is an axiom. For an RA-node or CA-node, the **defeasible** property indicates whether the corresponding rule is defeasible (the default) or not.

The **defeasible** and **known** properties provide the information needed to create [ASPIC+](https://doi.org/10.1080/19462166.2013.869766) from the generated AIF – or to create ASPIC+ directly from GraphML. The **id** property is there to support the latter case, where it becomes the name of the logical proposition representing the I-node. This is not strictly necessary (one-up integer labels could be used instead for example), but does aid readability of the generated ASPIC+ statements. Similarly, it can also be used to generate blank-node ID’s in AIF for the same purpose.
