# Operation Fortitude

[Fortitude South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Fortitude#Fortitude_South_2) was the Allied operation in WW2 to divert the focus of German defences away from the planned Normandy landings by suggesting that the Pas de Calais was the intended landing site for the invasion of mainland Europe. Here, we use it to explore the utility of argumentation in [Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_competing_hypotheses).

## The Analyst Perspective

We start with a [walk-through](https://dstl.github.io/eleatics/argumentation/fortitude/fortitude.xhtml) the steps of the ACH method.

## The Technical Perspective

As well as [applying argumentation to ACH](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/wiki/Analysis-of-Competing-Hypotheses), this example demonstrates linking arguments derived through structural analytic techniques with arguments expressed explicitly by analysts. The arguments are [labelled](https://dstl.github.io/eleatics/argumentation/fortitude/schemes.xhtml) according to [Argumentation Schemes](https://github.com/dstl/eleatics/wiki/Argumentation-Schemes) that can be used in evaluating and explaining the argument as a whole.
