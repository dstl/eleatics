# The Jesuits Massacre

See the [1989 murders of Jesuits in El Salvador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_murders_of_Jesuits_in_El_Salvador) Wikipedia page for a description of this atrocity committed during the Salvadoran Civil War. Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack - and initial reports contained claim and counter-claim about who was responsible for the murders. The truth emerged over time, ultimately leading to a comprehensive description of events in a [UN Truth Commission report](http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html).

Contemperaneous reports relating to the massacre can be found in the [MUC-3 corpus](https://github.com/dstl/muc3). These can be used to demonstrate developing hypotheses based on testimonial evidence, and in updating hypotheses over time in the light of new evidence.
