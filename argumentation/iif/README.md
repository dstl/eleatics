# Intelligent Infrastructure Futures

The [Government Office for Science](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-office-for-science) have published the [Futures toolkit for policy-makers and analysts](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/futures-toolkit-for-policy-makers-and-analysts). This is about long-term strategic thinking, and it describes tools to apply critical thinking and develop consensus. This mix of speculation and dialogue makes [foresight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresight_(futures_studies)) a good use case for argumentation.

The Futures toolkit links to some worked examples. We will focus on just one of those here: [Intelligent Infrastructure Futures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/intelligent-infrastructure-futures).
