Applying intelligence leads to improvements that are lost again as people take the gains to perpetuate resource-intensive lifestyles.

The application of ‘intelligent technology’ can be driven by the pressure to rectify a worsening problem. The policy adopted, for political and cost reasons, may often be a technology fix. The result of this fix is to relieve the symptom for a while – for example, engines that are more energy-efficient. However, there are often unintended consequences – such as people eventually taking the gains as bigger vehicles with bigger engines. Thus, the original problem returns, often worse and more entrenched than it was before.

Applying intelligence is coupled with redesigning the work and built environments in a way that encourages people to take the gains as a shift in lifestyle.

If the basic application of technology takes longer, and is more robust and fundamental, then it is not technological sticking plaster but well-designed cure. The gains are taken towards sustainability, so there develops a dual tackling of the fundamental infrastructure problems - one from technology applications and the other from changes in values and lifestyle.

Gains from intelligent infrastructure must encourage a sustainable shift of lifestyle.
