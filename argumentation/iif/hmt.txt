What benefits will humans bring to machines?

Humans train the machines.

Humans explain the output of the machines.

Humans sustain the responsible use of the machine.



What benefits will machines bring to humans?

Machines can amplify the human teammate’s cognitive strengths.

Machines can interact with other members of the system to free the human operator for higher-level tasks.

Machines can embody human skills to extend the human operator’s physical capabilities.



What makes for a good Human-AI team?

The machine is accountable to humans.

The machine is aware of speculative risks and benefits.

The human-AI team interface is honest, usable and interpretable.

The team is respectful and secure.

The machine should not have the final say on critical decisions, which include those that affect a person’s life, quality of life, health, or reputation. Instead, they should offer data and assistance to the human operator.

Decisions that can be made by the machine independently should appeal to the human teammate and be reversible.

It is important to consider the level of responsibility for each human member of the team.

The machine should be aware of potential risks and benefits of the system and the environment it is operating in. Ideally, the machine would be able to highlight these potential risks and benefits well in advance of the human operator.

This will give the human plenty of time to consider the outcomes.

(sustainable)
AI must be ensured to function properly, safely, and responsibly in a consistent fashion. This is particularly true when the human-AI team is working on critical systems that concern human lives, such as self-driving cars and in defence applications
